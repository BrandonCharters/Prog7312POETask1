Replacing books game

-----------------------------------------------------
** Brief description of application **
-----------------------------------------------------
The app is a WinForms application which consists of the home page where the user will be able to choose what game they want to play. At the moment the user will only be able to select the replacing books game.The other pages of the application are the game page itself, this is where the user will play the replacing books game. And the final page is the rule form, this form is shown to the user when the rule button on the game page is pressed.
The game involves the user dragging and dropping unsorted books from one listbox to the other in the correct order, there are varying difficulty levels to the game such as easy, medium, and hard.

** Setup/Installation Requirements **
-----------------------------------------------------
Things you will need:
• Preferably Visual studio 2022 to avoid issues and errors.
• File unzipper, such as WinRar.

The file I have submitted is a zip file, you will need to unzip it to access my application.

Once unzipped follow through the folders until reaching a folder named "Prog7312POETask1.sln" , you will be required to open the 
“.sln” file in VS2022 which has the visual studio image next to it. 

Once the application has loaded, right click on the solution file on the right side and build the solution.
Once that is complete, to run the application you will need to press on the green arrow at the top of the 
page.

** Running the application **
-----------------------------------------------------
When you run the app, you will be displayed the homepage of the app. On this page you will see the option to play three different games, only the replacing books game is available at the moment.

Press on the replacing books button to be taken to the game page.

Once on the game page, you will have the ability to look at the rules of the game by pressing the “rules” button in the top left hand corner of the screen.

Once you have read how the game is played then you will be required to choose what difficulty you want to play, such as easy, medium, and hard. Based on what difficulty is chosen that will determine the amount of time you will have to sort the books.

Once a difficulty is chosen then you will be required to press the “start” button to start the game.

When the game starts the timer will be displayed and so will the books. You will now be required to drag and drop the books from the left listbox to the right listbox from smallest to biggest based on the numbers of the dewey decimal value.

When you are done ordering the books, you will need to press the done button to check if the order of the books is correct.

If you want to restart at any time during the game, press the “Restart” button.

If the timer runs out then you will be given the choice to play the game again or exit the app.

At any moment in time you can press the X in the top right corner of the pages to exit the app.
